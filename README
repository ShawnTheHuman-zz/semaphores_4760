Project 3 - 4706

Compiled with "make"

How to Run:
    ./runsim [ -t sec ] n < testing.data

    n must be an integer greater than zero and '-t sec' is the optional max run time specified by the user. 


Issues: 
    its printing something weird at the end of each log but the other information is correct.
